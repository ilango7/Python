# MY FIRST PYTHON PROJECT 
so this project started as an assignment given by my python teacher to write a simple algoritm that converts ferehnite temperature to celcius temperature by simply writing an equation.

Then i simply added a basic integer that calculates the sum of two numbers which was intensionlly a wrong answer. 
and for the final i looked up for a really simple "magic trick" on google in which either number youll choose it will get the same result.
